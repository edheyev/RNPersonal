        I am interested in how space is represented in memory and how we can use
        innovative research techniques and technologies to investigate this. The
        interaction of egocentric and allocentric spatial representations has
        been a focus for my research at MSc and PhD level, using virtual reality
        technology and psychophysical methods to investigate these topics from a
        cognitive psychological perspective. My PhD thesis which focusses on
        these subjects is available online{" "}
